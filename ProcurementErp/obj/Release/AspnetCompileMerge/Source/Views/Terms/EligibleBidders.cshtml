    <p class="text-justify">
        Proposals may be submitted by domestic and/or foreign bidders from any country eligible for public tenders under the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.  Each bidder will be responsible for applying for and obtaining all permits and licenses necessary to perform the services under the Form of Agreement and shall satisfy itself according to the procedures and timeframes required for such consents and licenses.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Each bidder must describe any potential or actual conflict of interest or appearance of impropriety, relating to its other clients or to employees of UBN that might arise as a result of such bidder being awarded the Form of Agreement.  In addition, such bidder(s) shall indicate (in the RFP Response Proposal) procedures to be adopted to detect, notify UBN of and resolve all such conflicts of interest.  Further, each bidder must indicate any pending litigation, regulatory action or other contingent liability that could have an adverse material impact on its ability to enter into and/or perform the Form of Agreement.

    <p class="text-justify">
        The bidder and all individual members composing any consortium must be business organisation(s) duly organised, existing, registered and in good standing under their respective laws of domicile.  No consortium may include a member that is a member or affiliate of another bidder.  Any introduction of, or changes to any consortium members after submission of the RFP Response Proposal must be approved by UBN.  Consortia bidders may be required to provide supplementary documentary material to UBN (including copies of the relevant joint venture or consortium agreements and powers of attorney with respect thereto or, in the case of unincorporated consortia, a declaration of joint and several liability), and must nominate one member to serve as the managing member of, and single point of contact for the consortium.
